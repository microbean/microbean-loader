   * Returns a {@link Type} representing the <em>lower type bound</em>

   *
   * <p>Often the value returned by implementations of this method is
   * no more specific than the lowest possible type, which is {@code
   * null}, meaning that the {@link Provider} has a chance of
   * {@linkplain #get(Loader, Path) producing} a {@link Value} for any
   * requested type.</p>
   *
   * <p>A return value of, for example, {@link String String.class}
   * indicates that the {@link Provider} may satisfy requests for
   * {@link String String.class}, or any of its supertypes (such as
   * {@link CharSequence} or {@link Object}), but cannot satisfy
   * requests for {@link Integer Integer.class}, for example.</p>
   *
   * <p>A return value of {@link Object Object.class} would be
   * extremely unusual and would indicate a maximally opaque type,
   * i.e. only requests for <em>exactly</em> {@link Object
   * Object.class} have the possibility of being satisfied by this
   * {@link Provider}.  Such a return value is possible, but rarely
   * used, and {@link Provider} implementations are urged to consider
   * returning a different {@link Type}.</p>
   *
   * <p>Note that this method is used solely to help eliminate types
   * from consideration, not permit them.  That is, although {@link
   * Provider} may indicate via an implementation of this method that
   * a given {@link Type} is suitable, it is not thereby obliged to
   * return a {@link Value} corresponding to it from its {@link
   * #get(Loader, Path) get(Loader, Path)} method implementation.</p>
   *
   * <p>The default implementation of this method returns {@code
   * null}.  Many {@link Provider} implementations will choose not to
   * override this method.</p>
   *
   * @return a {@link Type} representing the lower type bound of all
   * possible {@linkplain Value values} {@linkplain #get(Loader, Path)
   * supplied} by this {@link Provider}, or {@code null} to indicate
   * the lowest possible type bound
   *
   * @nullability This method always does, and overrides often may,
   * return {@code null}.
   *
   * @idempotency This method is, and overrides of this method must
   * be, idempotent and deterministic.
   *
   * @threadsafety This method is, and overrides of this method must
   * be, safe for concurrent use by multiple threads.
